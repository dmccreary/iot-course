# IOT Course Outline

## Audience

College students with a background in Python.

## Materials

Each student will be provided with:

1. A Raspberry Pi Pico "W"
2. A USB cable
2. A 1/2 size breadboard
3. A 128x64 OLED display
4. A Time-of-flight sensor
5. Various wires

1. Each student must provide a laptop with a USB port.
2. Each student must have an account on GitHub.

We will also provide examples of GPT-4 prompts that can be used to create, extend and debug your IoT code.  A generative AI account is encouraged but not required.
