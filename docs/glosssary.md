### Terms

#### 4G
Fourth-generation cellular network technology, providing faster data transmission speeds compared to 3G networks.

- Related to LTE, mobile internet, high-speed data transmission

#### Backhaul

The intermediate links between the core network and small subnetworks at the edge of the entire network.

- Related to network infrastructure, data transport, broadband

#### Bluetooth

A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances using short-wavelength UHF radio waves.

- Related to wireless communication, IoT devices, personal area networks

#### Cloud

Centralized data storage and processing services accessed over the internet.

- Related to data centers, cloud computing, remote processing

#### Data Logging

The process of collecting and storing data over time, often from sensors or instruments.

- Related to data analysis, monitoring, IoT sensors

#### DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
The use of digital processing (like computers or specialized DSP chips) to analyze, modify, or synthesize signals such as sound, images, and sensor data.

- Related to signal analysis, data compression, noise reduction

#### I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

A multi-master, multi-slave, packet-switched, single-ended, serial computer bus widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers.

- Related to communication protocol, microcontrollers, peripheral devices

#### IRQ (Interrupt Request)

A hardware signal sent to the processor that temporarily stops a running program and allows a special program, an interrupt handler, to run instead.

- Related to computer hardware, interrupts, microprocessors

#### MicroPython

A lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language, designed to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

- Related to embedded systems, Python programming, IoT development

#### SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)

A synchronous serial communication interface specification used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems.

- Related to data transfer, microcontrollers, communication protocol

#### TinyML
Refers to machine learning technologies capable of performing on-device analytics at extremely low power, suitable for tiny devices.

- Related to artificial intelligence, low-power devices, edge computing

#### WiFi

A family of wireless network protocols, based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, used for local area networking of devices and internet access.

- Related to wireless networking, internet connectivity, routers

#### Ubiquitous Computing

The potential of the total, widespread adoption of connected devices and their benefits. Also known as pervasive computing, it can be described as the saturation of devices ingrained in work, life, and logistics.
